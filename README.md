# Multiplayer Car Racing

Car Racing is a small racing game to showcase the possibility of running
Flame and Forge2D in DartPad.

In this game, I took on the challenge to build a game completely without
assets, since you can't have assets in DartPad (yet). 
I could of course have pulled in network assets, but decided that the
challenge of not having any assets at all made it more fun.
